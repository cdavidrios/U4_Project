# U4_Project
This repository contains experiments for the classification of different Alzheimer's dementia stages from Magnetic Resonance Imaging using Deep Learning Techniques.


The proposed work was divided in 3 sections: 

In the first one, we designed 4 differents architectures for Convolutional Neural Networks to classify the dementia stages in Alzheimer. 

In the second section, we used a TensorFlow Hub model to classify in two different ways the stages of Alzheimer: 1) using classic SVM classifier and 2) using fully connected layers. 

Finally, in the last section we performed Transfer Learning from AlexNet.
